          <h1>Privacy Policy for Retitrak's Audit, Monitoring & Compliance Application.</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>This is the privacy policy of Retinaad Limited regarding the collection, use and disclosure of
            your personal information when you use the Application.</p>
          <p>The protection of consumer privacy has always been a fundamental guideline in the
            development of Retinaad’s RetiTrak technology. Our software is designed to provide
            insightful data by means of fully anonymous measurements.</p>
          <p>RetiTrak is a tool for the verification and monitoring of advertising, sales and marketing
            activities including static OOH, digital DOOH, BTL, Sales kiosks and Assets.</p>
          <p>RetiTrak’s software employs advanced AI and Machine Learning Algorithms, not facial
            recognition technologies. Tracking data is generated from aggregate measurements of photo
            images: think of it as a “smart turnstile”.</p>
          <p>RetiTrak’s software never collects any information that is uniquely associated to an
            individual; photographic images are assessed purely from visual cues. All video processing is
            performed locally in real time so that no human face recognition is required.</p>
          <p>RetiTrak software is privacy protecting and complies with the requirements imposed by the
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will not use or share your information with
            anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>We use your personal information for providing and improving the Application. By using the
            Application, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
            policy.</p>
          <h3>1. Information Collection And Use</h3>
          <p>While using the Application, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable
            information may include, but is not limited to, your email address, name ("Personal
            Information").</p>
          <p>The purpose for which we collect personal information is to provide you with the best
            service experience possible on the Application and for our internal business purposes that
            form part of normal business practices. Some provision of personal information is optional.
            However, if you do not provide us with certain types of personal information, you may be
            unable to enjoy the full functionality of the Application.</p>
          <h3>2. Log Data</h3>
          <p>We may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Application
            ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet
            Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the sections of the Application that
            you use, the time and date of your usage and other statistics.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor
            and analyze this type of information in order to increase the Application's functionality.
            These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use
            such information.</p>
          <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
          <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique
            identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer's
            hard drive.</p>
          <p>We use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies
            or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may
            not be able to use some portions of our Application.</p>
          <p>We send a session cookie to your computer when you log in to your User account. This type
            of cookie helps if you visit multiple pages on the Application during the same session, so
            that you don't need to enter your password on each page. Once you log out or close your
            browser, this cookie expires.</p>
          <p>We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your Content and
            account information. We encode our cookie so that only we can interpret the information
            stored in them. Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser
            preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our
            Application may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower.</p>
          <p>You can change your browser settings to delete or prevent certain cookies from being
            stored on your computer or mobile device without your explicit consent. The ‘help’ section
            in your browser should provide information on how to manage your cookie settings.</p>

          <h3>4. Service Providers</h3>
          <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Application, to
            provide the Application on our behalf, to perform Application-related services or to assist us
            in analyzing how the Application is used.</p>
          <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on
            our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
          <h3>5. Compliance With Laws</h3>
          <p>We may disclose personal information in special situations where we have reason to believe
            that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging,
            injuring or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users or
            anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
          <p>We will disclose your Personal Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if
            we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests
            of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of the Application.</p>
          <h3>6. Business Transaction</h3>
          <p>In the event that we sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in transfers,
            acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control and other similar transactions,
            customer or user information is generally one of the transferable business assets. Thus, your
            personal information may be subject to such a transfer. In the unlikely event of insolvency,
            personal information may be transferred to a trustee or debtor in possession and then to a
            subsequent purchaser.</p>
          <h3>7. Security</h3>
          <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method
            of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
            strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <h3>8. International Transfer</h3>
          <p>Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to — and maintained
            on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental
            jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>If you are located outside Nigeria and choose to provide information to us, please note that
            we transfer the information, including Personal Information, to Nigeria and process it there.</p>
          <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information
            represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
          <h3>9. Access and Correction</h3>
          <p>The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Section 38 as well as the Data Protection
            Act 2023 allows you to get access to, and correct, the personal information we hold about
            you in certain circumstances. If you would like to obtain such access, please contact us on
            the details set out above.</p>
          <p>Please note that the access and correction requirements under this Privacy Policy operates
            alongside and do not replace other informal or legal procedures by which an individual can
            be provided access to, or correction of, their personal information, including the
            requirements under the Freedom of Information Act 2011.</p>
          <h3>10. Complaints</h3>
          <p>The implementation framework for the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation allows you to
            make a complaint about any alleged breaches of privacy. In order to lodge a complaint with
            us, please contact us using the details above with the following information:</p>

          <p>URL link to the alleged breach of privacy (if applicable).</p>
          <p>Please allow us 30 days to investigate your complaint, after which we will contact you
            immediately to resolve the issue.</p>
          <h3>11. Retention of Information</h3>
          <p>We retain information for as long as required, allowed, or we believe it is useful, but do not
            undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without
            notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of
            information. You must keep your own, separate back-up records.</p>
          <h3>12. Links To Other Sites</h3>
          <p>The Application may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a
            third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
            review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
          <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or

          <p>The Application is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>

            you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with
            Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected
            Personal Information from children under 18 without verification of parental consent, we
            take steps to remove that information from our servers or replace it with the Personal
            Information of the Children’s parent or guardian.</p>
